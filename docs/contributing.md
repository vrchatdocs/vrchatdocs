# Contributing

To contribute, first, fork a copy of the repository to your GitHub account.

![Fork by well, clicking the "Fork" button.](images/fork.png)

Next make your changes, and commit them by doing the following in your command prompt, with the project folder in
context:

    cd [Path to your copy of the documentation]
    git add -A
	git commit -m "Describe your changes here."
	git push origin master

Finally, visit [this page](https://github.com/vrchatdocs/vrchatdocs/compare) and select your forked repository,
and maybe write a brief about what you've done and/or why it should be merged into the published version.
